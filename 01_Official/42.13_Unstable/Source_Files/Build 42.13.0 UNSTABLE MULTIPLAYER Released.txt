FAO MODDERS

 

Please see the linked guide for information on how to update your mods to work with 42.13.0 and beyond, and how to make your mods MP compatible.

 

 

MULTIPLAYER DETAILS


The Multiplayer build is WIP for stress testing. To ensure a smoother experience and simplify bug tracking and resolution, please adhere to the following guidelines before joining a MP session:

- Disable Debug and Mods (even client ones).
- Disable Ragdoll physics.
- We strongly recommend only playing in coop or on whitelisted servers.
- We do not recommend having more than 20 player-slots on your Dedi servers for now.

 


NEW

 

- Improved target selection when aiming firearms. The system now prioritizes body parts, making the head the primary target, followed by the spine, pelvis, and then other limbs. 

 

- Inventory/Object Interaction:
    - Update items that can be equipped/unequipped while walking
       -- Appropriate clothing and container items can be equipped while walking, such as hats, gloves, glasses, satchels, backpacks, etc.
       -- If a character is walking while also performing the unequip action for a clothing or container item that cannot be worn while walking then the unequip action will be cancelled.
    - Added a new body location slot, "satchel". Satchels, water bags, and cowboy canteens now all use the body location slot "satchel". Water bags and cowboy canteens previously used the ammo_strap body location. Satchels previously used the back body location.
    - Double Clicking on Items in inventory should perform non-destructive actions if appropriate.
        - Double Clicking on Bandages now applies them to an injury. If there are multiple body parts that can benefit from being bandaged, then the body part that is inflicting the most current damage will be the one that is bandaged.
        - Double-clicking on literature and map items that are in the players inventory, will, if they are supposed to be readable by the player, will start the reading actions.
        - Double clicking on containers that don't have a body location or in-hand model will still equip them. How what hand is equipped is as follow:
            -- If the secondary hand if empty then it is equipped in the secondary hand.
            -- Otherwise if the primary hand is empty then it is equipped in the primary hand.
            -- Otherwise, regardless of what already is in the secondary hand, it is equipped in the secondary hand.
        - Lighters and Walkie Talkies will be equipped and turned on when double clicked while in a character's inventory.
        - Double clicking on items in the players inventory that can be activated, such as flashlights, will equip-and-activate if unequipped, or unequip-and-deactivate in equipped.
          -- Candles and Hurricane Lanterns aren't included with this, as they don't work like Flashlights.
          -- Double clicking on unlit Candles and Hurricane Lanterns in a players inventory will, if the player has a lighting object, automatically light and equip the Candle or Lantern.
        - Double-clicking on boxes/bundles/cartons/etc of item in the players inventory will unpack them.

    - Items that can be turned on or off will have an "(On)" suffix in their display names when they are turned on.
    - Items like Flashlights will now turn off when not equipped.
    - When an item is equipped from the hotbar and it’s not a weapon, it will be placed in the secondary slot. If the slot is already occupied and the primary slot is free, it'll be equipped there.

    - Added properties to control light being filtered through closed curtains. Details for Modders/Mappers: 
      1) LightFilterR/G/B can be used to change the color of light passing through curtains.
         The value ranges from 0 to 255.
      2) LightFilterIntensity is the percentage of light allowed to pass through a curtain.
         The value ranges from 0 to 100. 100 allows all the light through.
      3) LightFilterMix is a percentage of original light color to act as minimum RGB values.
         The value ranges from 0 to 100.
        -- The time it takes a room to fade to black, and how black the room gets, can be configured with the configRoomFade(seconds, percent) Lua command.

TECH / CODE CLEAN-UP / DEBUG

- Updated JRE to Java 25.

 

- Added back BodyLocationGroup.getOrCreateLocation(String) which is needed by clothing mods.
- Added cheat display in debug in the water mark.

 

- The Linux version will use Wayland if available and the -Dzomboid.wayland=1 JVM option is used.
  -- This required moving keyboard initialisation until after window creation, only when Wayland is used.
  -- Known issues: While testing Wayland, it does not seem to be enabled by default on Linux using Wayland. It is also not possible to enable it through any Steam commands, since the “Dzomboid” flag is only a jvm command.

 

- Added extra details to Tile Geometry Editor buttons
- Change ScriptParser prettyPrint methods to use four-space indentation instead of tabs.
- Added displaying the elements in java.util.List subclasses and ItemContainer.Items in the Lua debugger, instead of the fields of the list object.
- Added a line-number entry to source windows in the Lua debugger
- QOL improvements to the Lua debugger's ObjectViewer.
    - Added a text filter to make finding fields easier.
    - Added a PREV button to display the previous object, after double-clicking on a field.
    - Changed KahluaTableImpl.toString() from "table 0x12345678" to "Type 0x12345678" for tables that
      have a "Type" field, which includes all our Lua object and class tables.  So it will say "ISButton 0x12345678"
      for example.
    - Added displaying a table's <metatable> as an element of the table.  This can be used to peruse a table's class definition or superclass definition.
    - Fixed TextureViewer's default size to handle the title-bar adornments and title.
- Fixed the cursor blink rate of text-entry boxes in the Lua debugger
- Fixed the Lua debugger sometimes displaying the wrong value for a local variable.
- All the setExclusive() and setAltModel() calls in BodyLocations.lua should also use the ItemBodyLocation enum.
- Converted ItemBodyLocation enum to class
- Added ConcurrentHashMap to support mods adding custom ItemBodyLocations

 

- Added the functions canStand and hasAdjacentCanStandSquare to IsoGridSquare.java.
- Added the function hasAdjacentCanStandSquare to IsoObject.java.
- These functions check to see if a player can stand in a square, or can stand in an adjacent square.
- Updated AdjacentFreeTileFinder.lua to use IsoGridSquare.canStand.
- Used the hasAdjacentCanStandSquare functions to check for an adjacent square that a player can stand in several randomizedBuilding classes when evaluating whether a square or tile should spawn surface clutter inventory items.
- This is to ensure that surface clutter inventory items don't spawn in circumstances where a player is unable to reach them 
- Refactored some code in ItemContainer and InventoryPage to better handle circumstances where a seat is occupied and has a reduced capacity.
- Warn when you accidentally would overwrite a method using a field in the Lua Exposer.

 

- Added CharacterStat class for unified handling of character stats; uses a registry with static definitions for Stats attributes.
- Refactored Stats.java to leverage CharacterStat.
- Replaced Drunkenness stat usage with CharacterStat.INTOXICATION.
- Replaced StressFromCigarettes with CharacterStat.NICOTINE_WITHDRAWAL.
- Consolidated and replaced BoredomLevel stat usage with CharacterStat.BOREDOM.
- Removed legacy Fear stat.

 

- Introduced a namespaced resource system (ResourceLocation, Registry) to unify resource management.  Over time, more internal enums and classes will adopt this system, allowing mods to register entries with their own namespaces and improving mod compatibility.
- Added namespace resource system for modding support.
- ResourceLocation represents namespace identifiers (namespace:path), with validation, parsing, and equals/hashCode methods.
- Registry<T> is a generic, namespace-aware registry system supporting registration via ResourceLocation IDs, lookup by ID or string, and iteration over entries.
- ResourceLocationPanel is a debug ImGui panel for viewing registry entries.
- Refactored ItemTag from an enum to a class with registry support.
- Refactored ItemBodyLocation to include registry support.
- Updated related files to support the new registry system.
- Refactored classes no longer use strings for identifiers; instead, type-safe objects are used, reducing errors and improving code safety.

- Fixed incorrect modData values being set in ItemCodeOnCreate breaking brochures and fliers.


- Fixed modData values for some things in ItemCodeOnCreate to match the old Lua code.

- Removed duplicated tiles
